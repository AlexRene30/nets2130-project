### Project Kinnect 

Our final deliverable will be the live, deployed “Kinnect” web app. This MVP will be focused and functional, limited to its four core, must-have features: 1) user account creation/ID, 2) a simple manual activity logging form, 3) team assignment/selection, and 4) a basic, list-based leaderboard. It will include the real-world results from our live user test. 

More complex features for final product:
- Weekly individual challenges
- Team matchups / bracket
- Reminder emails to complete challenges
- Set personal goals

We will present the data and key insights we collected from our users, as this is the ultimate proof that our incentive model works. This all gets wrapped up in a concise final presentation where we will demo the live app, show our data graphs (e.g., user engagement over time, team comparisons), and provide an honest analysis of what worked, what failed, and what the clear, data-driven next steps would be.
